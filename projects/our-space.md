I created this app as a gift for my significant other since
We are in a long distance relationship. The idea is that each week we write each other a card about us.

I am now in the process of expanding the app so other people can create their accounts and do the same.

### Tools stack

I used the **Angular** framework for the frontend, with **Typescript** and **Sass**. The backend uses **firebase** for Authentication and database. I’m quite familiar with both which sped up the development process. Furthermore, since SEO is not a priority for this app, i.e. no SSR needed, I can host it on Firebase Hosting for free.

For the styling, I wrote my own instead of relying on a library  because the project is quite simple, no fancy things required at the moment, and, no visual library seems to fit in well with the style I’m going for.
